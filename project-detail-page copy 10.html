The first performer is in the foreground. He is black and has a mustache. He wears a black baseball cap, the green and yellow colours of the Jamaican flag and the word Jamaica are slightly visible on top of the cap. He wears a brown blazer, unbuttoned. His shirt is black with large off-white cross details. His eye-catching tie has a repeating pattern of bright blue, green, yellow, and pink shapes. The performer in the background is slightly obscured by the mic stand of the other performer. He is white and wears small circular glasses. He wears a long-sleeved black and grey pinstriped shirt and a grey tie with a marble effect. The background behind the performers is dark.">

            <li data-visual="website-design-florentina-norfolk"><img src="images/work/3 - Low Midgitte Bardot RAW Cabaret Bluecoat 2019 .jpg" alt="A performer with dwarfism on stage. She sits on a red chair pouring red wine from a bottle into a glass. She wears a clownishly sad expression on her face as well as heavy white clown makeup, red circles on her cheeks, and overlined red lips. She wears a long blonde wig with lots of curls and a small black slip dress with black tights and heels. The background behind her is dark but there is subtle blue lighting which washes the floor and outlines the performer, adding to the sense of heightened sadness in the image.">

The crutches hold her up as she lies down on them, facing the ceiling. She wears a black leotard and black tutu and has very short platinum blonde hair. She and the stage are washed in high contrast pink and orange light. Behind her on the backdrop of the stage is a square made of large planks of wood.">
