Colored blotches ranging from greenish white to deep blue decorate the center of his shirt, blending with the background of the photo. He is pictured in front of a large blue background projection. The text on the projection reads “(T)HE PRODUCT IS RECLAIMING… USED DETRIMENTALLY TO DISABLED PEOPLE IN THE PAST” the quote is attributed to the daily record.">

In the foreground, one performer on the left holds her fingers up to each other, her face reared up in shock and indignation, the woman to her right patiently observing with her hands clasped together at her midsection.">

To the far right of the image is a small CRT/Box television sat atop a wardrobe, as well as an 80’s inspired boombox hung upon a set of hooks on the wall. Three performers, two young women and a young man dressed in sporty and casual attire are stood in the center of the image behind the central character in the shot, a man with a short shaved head in a wheelchair. On the far left of the image, a man with no legs is sitting next to a young woman on a bright blue table set low off the ground.">
