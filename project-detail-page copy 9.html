                <p>Working on the DaDa exhibition has encouraged me to dive further into the arts as someone who comes under the 'disabled' label. It has highlighted to me the depth and positive effect of such organisations on the community through diving into archival photographs and immersing myself in the work of DaDa. Being on the creative side of a project like this has opened my eyes to the benefits (as well as considerations) of creating a display with such importance and influence on individuals and the community. - Raniyah Sandhu</p>

He speaks passionately, this comes across in his animated facial expression and raised hand gesture. He holds a book entitled 'Redundant Butties.' His humorous look, coupled with the title of the book hint that he is performing comedy. A table stands to his left and upon the table are three other books stacked in a scattered way.">

            <li data-visual="website-design-florentina-norfolk"><img src="images/work/6 - akadoo_ DaDaFest November 2007 .jpg" alt="A merry train of people careening towards the left, two men followed by a woman followed by a semi-obscured man. It is playful, carefree. Their arms swoop out in an avian dance, the mute red light pinking their skin as if they have been caught mid-transformation into flight. The first man is shadowed, his head limned in the glow. His grin, wide as the skin beside his eyes is creased, is unbridled delight. The light pierces through his ear, as, directly behind him, the second man involves the viewer in the act with a thin, cheeky smirk. /Wouldn't you like to join us?/ he seems to say. The woman behind him has been captured, open-mouthed, totally caught in the groove. There is little to be seen of the final man, but his left hand reaches forward, mid-click, almost invisible but not quite. Not enough to be forgotten. Shadow reaches up from the bottom right, turning dark tones to black. Their dress is formal, pressed shirts and sombre jumpers, but it bears no constriction on these people, who are vivacious in their childish glee.">
