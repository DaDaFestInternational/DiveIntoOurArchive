    <h1><strong>DaDa @ 40: Dive into our Archive</strong></h1>
    <h1>We are DaDa, Liverpool’s pioneering disability arts organisation. This year we are celebrating our 40th anniversary.</h1>
    <h1>The ten posters around you show snapshots from DaDa’s history championing, developing and celebrating the work of disabled, d/Deaf and neurodivergent artists. With thanks to: Helen Webster, Everyman Theatre; Ruth Fabby.</h1>
    <h1>Click on the images below to explore the artwork further. <a href="https://uk.culturecounts.cc/s/6F714H">Click here to give us feedback.</a></h1>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        They were chosen by the current group of Young Producers here at the Everyman. They took a dive into our archive and came up with a collection of images that reflects DaDa’s ongoing work as an agent of change, using the arts to disrupt the status quo and to fight for equality for disabled people. 
    </a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        Dean Horrocks, Elsie Stump, Grace Lister-Akerman, Lottie Bluewater, Raniyah Sandhu and Scout Dragon worked with curator Gill Crawshaw on their selection. Gill’s curatorial approach is informed by her experience of activism in the disabled people’s movement. This fits closely with DaDa’s role at the forefront of disability arts, proud to be part of the wider disability rights movement.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        The Young Producers have brought another perspective, and their choice of images fits closely with our purpose and aims. They show disabled artists and performers as powerful, talented, layered and complex individuals.</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        “Selecting the photos was a powerful process, with many of them resonating deeply and reinforcing how art is activism, especially within the context of disability, and how creativity can drive change.” - Scout Dragon</a></p>
    <p class="em" style="display: none;">
        “We felt that the images connected with the theme of ‘a quiet riot’, with passion, togetherness, and exciting and significant pieces of performance art being key elements that influenced our choices.” - Lottie Bluewater</a></p>

<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 2.html"><img src="images/work/14 - Mat Fraser DaDaFest 20082.jpg" alt="A man, Mat Fraser, stands on stage performing. He has shortened arms and holds a microphone in the bend of his wrist. He wears a dark green leather blazer, buttoned up, with a large pocket. The blazer has a gold trim which outlines the lapels and pocket. The background behind him is dark, flares of orange and yellow light burst through and bathe his skin. The camera perspective looks up at him as he performs passionately with his eyes lit up."><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 2</h2></summary></div></a></li>
<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 3.html"><img src="images/work/9 - dadaverse Gabby A DaDaFest 20072.jpg" alt="Gabby is singing at an open mic night. An animated expression shows on her face, there is a sense of catharsis and release in her facial expression. She wears a purple ribbed jumper and black earrings that dangle. The pattern of the earrings appear as a shadow on her neck, accentuated by where the stage lighting hits her. The lighting is warm with pink undertones."><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 3</h2></summary></div></a></li>
<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 4.html"><img src="images/work/5 - Wicked Fish DaDaFest 20052.jpg" alt="two people seated between gingham-laid tables. A woman on the left, a man on the right. A moment of solace in an everyday setting. The woman's expression, though partly obscured by her hat, is sweet, half-smiling. Her body is angled towards the man, open and inviting in her support, tipping off her chair in her eagerness to offer it. They are linked by a bridge formed of her extended arm. It hovers between them as her fingers, firmly rooted to his shoulder, join them in connection. Though there is a distance of mere inches between herself and the man, his expression is faraway, mired in a world that the woman, despite her tender extension, does not appear to be conscious of. He holds his dipped face in his right hand, his mouth a rictus of disbelief. His left crosses his chest as if to keep emotion contained. Light shafts from the upper left, illuminating her fluorescent jacket. It is an angelic angle. Towards the left, her jacket glows, and the light, as it pools on the arms and the trousers of the man, seems to have been filtered by her. It bathes the two tables framing the subjects. These tables, dressed in a closely checked red and white cloth, each carry a burning red vase and a salt shaker. The one beside the man holds a flower-patterned mug and a basket in addition. Holistically, it is a warm, hopeful image. It impresses upon the viewer the quote: This, too, shall pass."><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 4</h2></summary></div></a></li>

<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 6.html"><img src="images/work/2 – Low Little Peaches DaDa Cabaret November 2023 CROP.jpg" alt="A photograph of an androgynously dressed burlesque performer sitting provocatively upon the left arm of a pastel pink leather wheelchair. The performer is adorned in neon pink high heeled pumps and fishnet stockings, contrasted by a deep blue suit blazer, and matching top hat. The performer wears a heavy dark hued lip, winged eyeliner, and long lashes, all exhuming comfort and confidence. "><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 6</h2></summary></div></a></li>
<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 7.html"><img src="images/work/23 - 2008 DaDaFest Deaf Arts Events Neslysim clear box best2.jpg" alt="a minimalist blank white floor, crisp white curtains drape down the sides of the stages walls, the looming sense of SENSE itself fading with each second that passes the white liminal. The uncertainty of its location isn’t sated by the occupants on its stage floor. On our right we see a man, the same crisp white drapes hung across his body, a gown for a patient or their saviour. He sits on a brutal edged steel chair, comfort is its last priority. A woman is knelt by the side of the man, her arms and hands rest on the man’s left thigh, she rests her head, a sense of affirmation is seen through the woman’s body language, whilst the man shows non, a blank- vacant stare that looks through the woman’s body as if she was glass. Her head is turned to the left, facing away from us, though we cannot see if her eyes are open we can follow her presumed line of sight towards the far left hand side of the stage. The comfort of having both man and woman on stage at this very point is tested. A 5 foot tall glass box with just enough wide space as a conventional coffin. Crudely suspended, a man wrapped in wire and twine is hanging off the ground by 2 feet. His one free leg hanging, possible signs of defeat. Their face is bound by the same crisp white as the men, women and surroundings. The same way a bank teller would describe the appearance of the thief, visage smudged by the tights one would wear on their legs. Together, the couple and the suspended man share the same eerie space as its crisp white curtains project an almost silent static."><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 7</h2></summary></div></a></li>
<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 8.html"><img src="images/work/11 - Laurence Clark DaDaFest 2008 DaDaFest.jpg" alt="A young man with clean cut dark brown hair in a wheelchair pumps his fist in excitement and joy. Colored blotches ranging from greenish white to deep blue decorate the center of his shirt, blending with the background of the photo. He is pictured in front of a large blue background projection. The text on the projection reads “(T)HE PRODUCT IS RECLAIMING… USED DETRIMENTALLY TO DISABLED PEOPLE IN THE PAST” the quote is attributed to the daily record."><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 8</h2></summary></div></a></li>
<li><a href="project-detail-page copy 9.html"><img src="images/work/1 – Low Sean Fallows – Poet  DaDa Cabaret November 20232.jpg" alt="A man is performing on stage, he is seated in an electric wheelchair. He speaks passionately, this comes across in his animated facial expression and raised hand gesture. He holds a book entitled 'Redundant Butties.' His humorous look, coupled with the title of the book hint that he is performing comedy. A table stands to his left and upon the table are three other books stacked in a scattered way."><div class="overlay"><summary><h2>Panel 9</h2></summary></div></a></li>

The crutches hold her up as she lies down on them, facing the ceiling. She wears a black leotard and black tutu and has very short platinum blonde hair. She and the stage are washed in high contrast pink and orange light. Behind her on the backdrop of the stage is a square made of large planks of wood.
